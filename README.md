# Unyielding Pomodoro

Here is a tool that could help with productivity. It applies in a very simple way the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

Work as hard as you can ([get your shit done!](http://gyshido.com/)) for 25 minutes, then take a small break during 5 minutes.

Right now there is no interaction possible, but in the future, you could be able to enter what you plan to do during pomodoris, then have a daily report.
